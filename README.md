## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
*   `npm` or `yarn` package manager

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install NPM Packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by making a copy of the existing `.env.example` file (if it exists) or creating a new one.

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    
    Inside the `.env` file, you need to add your Generative AI API key.

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important!**
    > The AI features of this application will **not** work without a valid API key. You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

    ```.env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server**

    The application requires two processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI backend.

    *   **Terminal 1: Run the Next.js App**
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
        Your application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

    *   **Terminal 2: Run the Genkit AI Flows**
        ```sh
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This starts the local Genkit development server, which the Next.js app communicates with for all AI-related tasks.
